*/

SELECT id, first_name, last_name, join_date, country
FROM customer;


/*

*/

FROM movie

FROM review 


/*
4. Select all the information from the single_rental table.

Now, let's get down to business. The first possibility in our store is to rent a single movie for a certain period of time. Each rental has an id, rental_date (when the rent starts), rental_period (in days), the platform (desktop, mobile or tablet), customer_id, movie_id, payment_date (you can pay a few day after you rent) and the payment_amount, or the price.
*/

SELECT id, rental_date, rental_period, platform, customer_id, movie_id, payment_date, payment_amount
FROM single_rental;


/*
5. Select all the information from the subscription table.

Real movie lovers get a subscription instead of single rentals. Each subscription has an id, a length (in days), a start_date, a platform (same as the platforms for single rentals), payment_date, payment_amount and customer_id.

SELECT id, length, start_date, platform, payment_date, payment_amount, customer_id

/*
6. Select all the information from the giftcard table.

The last thing you can purchase are giftcards for someone else. Each giftcard has an id, amount_worth (30, 50 or 100 dollars to spend in our store), customer_id, payment_date and payment_amount.
*/

SELECT id, amount_worth, customer_id, payment_date, payment_amount
