Each train has an id, model, maximum speed expressed in km/h, production year, the number of first class seats and second class seats. Pretty intuitive, right?

2. Select all the information from the table route.

A route in our system is, in other words, a railroad connection between point A and B.

Each route has its own id, its friendly name, the from_city and the to_city, as well as the distance between these two cities in kilometers.

For simplicity, we assume that we only have intercity trains, i.e. there are no stations between from_city and to_city where the train could stop.

3. Select all the information from the table journey.

Journey in our database is what passengers can buy tickets for. Each journey has its own id, is operated by a certain train, goes via a certain route on a certain day.

Take a look at the first row: if you had wanted to go from Sheffield to Manchester with train 1 on 3 Jan 2016, you would have bought a ticket for journey with id 1.
